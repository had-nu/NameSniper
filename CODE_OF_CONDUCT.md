# Code of Conduct

## Our Purpose

*NameSniper* is an open-source tool designed for educational, ethical, and legal use within the OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) and cybersecurity communities. Born from a personal journey in cybersecurity, this project aims to support learners, inspire ethical reconnaissance practices, and empower security professionals and students. We welcome collaboration, but with a firm commitment to responsible use and ethical standards.

## OSINT Ethical Use Guidelines

### 1. Legal and Authorised Use Only
- *NameSniper* must only be used to collect and analyse **publicly available data** in compliance with local laws, regulations, and platform terms of service (e.g., Google API terms). Unauthorised access to private systems, scraping restricted data, or violating terms of service is illegal and can lead to severe legal, financial, and ethical consequences.  
- Use this tool responsibly in authorised settings—whether for educational purposes, security research, or threat intelligence—and always ensure your actions align with applicable data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

### 2. Respect for Privacy and Data Ethics
- OSINT does not mean “anything goes.” Even publicly available data can have privacy implications. Do not use *NameSniper* to harm, exploit, or invade the privacy of individuals or organisations. Avoid collecting or sharing personally identifiable information (PII) unless you have explicit consent or a lawful basis.  
- Be mindful of how data is used—do not contribute to doxxing, harassment, or any form of harm. If in doubt, consult a legal or cybersecurity expert before proceeding.

### 3. Transparency and Accountability
- When using *NameSniper* for research or reporting, be transparent about your methods and sources. Clearly distinguish between public data collected via OSINT and any assumptions or analysis you derive.  
- Do not misrepresent data gathered with *NameSniper* as factual if it’s incomplete or unverified. OSINT is a starting point, not a definitive truth.

### 4. Community Collaboration
- We encourage contributions to *NameSniper*—whether through code, feedback, or ideas—but expect all contributors to uphold these OSINT-specific ethical standards.  
- Be respectful, constructive, and inclusive in all interactions, whether on GitHub, forums, or other platforms tied to this project. Harassment, discrimination, or harmful behaviour will not be tolerated.

## Our Commitment

As the creator of *NameSniper*, my intent is to foster a community that promotes ethical OSINT practices, supports learning, and drives responsible innovation in cybersecurity. This tool is not intended to enable misuse, harm, or illegal activities. I’m committed to maintaining a space where contributors and users feel safe, respected, and aligned with the project’s mission.

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter or suspect misuse of *NameSniper*—such as illegal data collection, privacy violations, or unethical OSINT practices—or if you witness behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, please report it to me directly via GitHub Issues or email (insert contact if desired). All reports will be reviewed promptly and handled with discretion.

## Consequences of Misuse

- Misuse of *NameSniper* in violation of these guidelines, including unethical OSINT practices, may result in being barred from contributing to the project.  
- I reserve the right to report illegal activities to the appropriate authorities if necessary.

## Final Note

Let’s build a community that champions ethical OSINT, supports learning, and drives positive impact in cybersecurity. Use *NameSniper* to explore, research, and contribute—but always with integrity and respect for privacy, legality, and the OSINT ethos. Together, we can make this project a force for good in the security community.
